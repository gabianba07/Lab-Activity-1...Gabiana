    <h1>2002</h1>


<p> I will always remember<br>
The day you kissed my lips<br>
Light as a feather<br>
And it went just like this<br>     
No, it's never been better<br>
Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)<br>
Uh, we were only eleve<br>
But acting like grown-ups<br>
Like we are in the present<br>
Drinking from plastic cups<br>
Singing, "Love is forever and ever"<br>
Well, I guess that was true<br><br>
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>
On an old Mustang, where we sang<br>
Songs with all our childhood friends<br>
And it went like this, say<br><br>
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh<br>
Paint a picture for you and me<br>
On the days when we were young, uh<br>
Singing at the top of both our lungs<br><br>
Now we're under the covers<br>
Fast forward to eighteen<br>
We are more than lovers<br>
Yeah, we are all we need<br>
When we're holding each other<br>
I'm taken back to 2002 (ooh)<br>
Yeah<br><br>
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>
On an old Mustang, where we sang<br>
Songs with all our childhood friends<br>
And it went like this, say<br><br>
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>
Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh<br>
Paint a picture for you and me<br>
On the days when we were young, uh<br>
Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>
On the day we fell in love<br>
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br><br>
On the day we fell in love<br>
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods<br>
On an old Mustang, where we sang<br>
Songs with all our childhood friends<br>
Oh, now<br><br>
Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye<br>
Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me<br>
Better hit me, baby, one more time<br>
Paint a picture for you and me<br>
On the days when we were young<br>
Singing at the top of both our lungs<br>
On the day we fell in love<br>
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
On the day we fell in love<br>
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
On the day we fell in love<br>
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
On the day we fell in love<br>
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh<br>
On the day we fell in love, love, love<br></p>
